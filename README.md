### Description

This repo contains my cheatsheets for day to day sysadmin work

It is a go utility that you can install by downloading from bintray - https://bintray.com/upsumtech/artifacts/shutils

#### Contributing
Add a new sub command under the cmd dir or update existing ones and issue a pull request.
For now, i create the releases because i am the one with access to bintray, but if people are interested,
i am happy to add more folks to the org on bintray to be able to cut releases.
